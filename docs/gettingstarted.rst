Getting Started
===============

Now that stoQ is installed, getting up and running is extremely simple. stoQ can
be run a few different ways, depending on what your requirements are.

.. _workflow:

.. note: Each plugin class is optional. They can all be mix and matched as required.
         Additionally, multiple plugins of each class can be used simultaneously.


.. _configure:

Configuring stoQ
****************

.. _stoqcfg:

stoq.cfg
--------

stoQ's configuration file is not required, but does offer the convenience of overriding the
default configuration. An example configuration file can be found
`here <https://github.com/PUNCH-Cyber/stoq/blob/master/extras/stoq.cfg>`_. By default, stoQ will
look for ``stoq.cfg`` in ``$STOQ_HOME`` if running from the command line, or ``$CWD`` if being
used as a library.


Plugin options may also be defined in `stoq.cfg`. More information on how to configure plugins
in `stoq.cfg` can be found in :ref:`plugin configuration <pluginconfigstoqcfg>`.

.. _stoqhome:

$STOQ_HOME
----------

When using the ``stoq`` command, stoQ will default to using $HOME/.stoq as it's home directory.
This path is important as it is used as the default path for plugins and configuration files.
You can easily override this by setting the ``$STOQ_HOME`` environment variable. For example,
we can set stoQ's home directory to ``/opt/stoq`` like so::

    $ export $STOQ_HOME=/opt/stoq

Now, stoQ will look for plugins in ``/opt/stoq/plugins`` and the ``stoq.cfg`` configuration
file in ``/opt/stoq/stoq.cfg``.

One thing to note is, ``$STOQ_HOME`` is only valid when using the ``stoq`` command. If you are
using stoQ as a library, the default path will be ``$CWD``.

.. _runningstoq:

Running stoQ
************

The easiest way to get started is by running stoQ from the command line. There are two modes
available, `scan` and `run`. Before we get into what each more is used for, let's see how
installed plugins can be listed.

List Plugins
------------

Installed plugins can be easily listed by using the ``stoq`` command::

    $ stoq list

.. _scanmode:

Scan Mode
---------

`Scan mode` is designed for scanning an individual payload from the command line. This
is especially useful for lightweight tasks or one-off scans.

Let's get started. In this example, let's simply generate the MD5, SHA1, and SHA256
hashes of a file.

First, let's make sure we have the required plugins installed::

    $ stoq install --github stoq:hash

Now, let's run ``stoq`` with the ``hash`` plugin::

    $ stoq scan /tmp/bad.exe -s hash
    {
        "time": "...",
        "results": [
            {
                "payload_id": "0acfdfcf-f298-4950-96d2-13e3f93646b5",
                "size": 507904,
                "payload_meta": {
                    "should_archive": true,
                    "extra_data": {
                        "filename": "bad.exe"
                    },
                    "dispatch_to": []
                },
                "workers": {
                    "hash": {
                        "sha256": "47c6e9b402324ea6c54dd95ad3fdf4b48b18775053b105e241a371a3731488c0",
                        "md5": "16d9f6e5421d99beb46d7ab1500c1799",
                        "sha1": "9e6414bf28a2c98fbd13172817db80380c5eeb6a"
                    }
                }
                "archivers": {},
                "plugins_run": {
                    "workers": [
                        [
                            "hash"
                        ]
                    ],
                    "archivers": []
                },
                "extracted_from": null,
                "extracted_by": null
            }
        ],
        "request_meta": {
            "archive_payloads": true,
            "source": null,
            "extra_data": {}
        },
        "errors": {},
        "decorators": {},
        "scan_id": "5699d5ac-df3b-4ba1-bb38-296813d14d19"
    }

Great, now we've generated the needed hashes; but stoQ allows us to do way more
than just generate hashes. Let's also tell stoQ to use the ``peinfo`` plugin.
First, let's make sure the plugin is installed::

    $ stoq install --github stoq:peinfo

Ok, now let's scan the payload again, but this time we will use both plugins::

    $ stoq scan /tmp/bad.exe -s hash peinfo
    {
        "time": "...",
        "results": [
            {
                "payload_id": "38cb070d-c9e8-48be-84d9-6ee612489fe8",
                "size": 507904,
                "payload_meta": {
                    "should_archive": true,
                    "extra_data": {
                        "filename": "bad.exe"
                    },
                    "dispatch_to": []
                },
                "workers": {
                    "hash": {
                        "sha256": "47c6e9b402324ea6c54dd95ad3fdf4b48b18775053b105e241a371a3731488c0",
                        "md5": "16d9f6e5421d99beb46d7ab1500c1799",
                        "sha1": "9e6414bf28a2c98fbd13172817db80380c5eeb6a"
                        }
                    "peinfo": {
                        "imphash": "6238d5d3f08e2b63c437c2ba9e1f7151",

                }
                "archivers": {},
                "plugins_run": {
                    "workers": [
                        [
                            "hash",
                            "peinfo"
                        ]
                    ],
                    "archivers": []
                },
                "extracted_from": null,
                "extracted_by": null
            }
        ],
        "request_meta": {
            "archive_payloads": true,
            "source": null,
            "extra_data": {}
        },
        "errors": {},
        "decorators": {},
        "scan_id": "43f3210b-b4ce-41e5-b39a-5fb8dbbc45ac"
    }

Now, you've run the payload with two different plugins simply by adding it to your command
line. As you use stoQ, you will see the power this affords you. This is especially true
when you start delving into some of the more advanced use cases. There are quite a few other
command line options, we've only just scratched the surface. For more command line options
available in `scan mode`, just run::

    $ stoq scan -h


.. _runmode:

Run Mode
--------

`Run mode` is similar to `scan mode`, but is meant for handling multiple payloads or
for long running tasks. This mode requires the use of a `provider` plugin.

For this example, we will monitor a directory for new files. When new files are created,
the plugin will detect this and send the payload to stoQ for scanning. Chances are we won't
want the results to simply be displayed to the console, so we will also save the results to
disk.

First, let's make sure the required plugins are installed. Let's start with the ``dirmon``
plugin. This plugin monitors a directory for newly created files::

    $ stoq install --github stoq:dirmon

Now, time to install the ``filedir`` plugin. This plugin will save the results to disk::

    $ stoq install --github stoq:filedir

We'll monitor the directory ``/tmp/monitor`` for this example and save our results to
``/tmp/results``. Let's create these directories::

    $ mkdir /tmp/monitor /tmp/results

Since we already have the ``hash`` and ``peinfo`` plugins installed from the `scan mode`
example above, let's use them for scanning the payloads.::

    $ stoq run -P dirmon -C filedir -a hash peinfo \
        --plugin-opts dirmon:source_dir=/tmp/monitor \
        filedir:results_dir=/tmp/results

Now, let's copy ``bad.exe`` into the monitor directory::

    $ cp /tmp/bad.exe /tmp/monitor

Ok, stoQ should have detected ``bad.exe`` was created in ``/tmp/monitor`` and then scan the
content with the ``hash`` and ``peinfo`` plugins, then save the results to ``/tmp/results``.
Let's take a look::

    $ ls /tmp/results/
    1f168f68-1c19-46f9-9427-585345a6fe24

Great! We have successfully monitored a directory for new files, scanned them with two
plugins, and then saved the results to disk. Again, we've only scratched the surface as
to what stoQ can do. For more command line options in `run` mode, simply run::

    $ stoq run -h

Plugin configuration
--------------------

Plugin configurations may be defined in several ways, see :ref:`plugin configuration <pluginconfig>`.

RequestMeta Options
-------------------

RequestMeta options sets metadata associated with the initial request `stoQ` receives. This is
useful when certain metadata, such as the source name of the payload, must be saved alongside
the results of the scan.

There are two command line options avaiable for RequestMeta.

    - ``--request-source``
    - ``--request-extra``

To set ``--request-source`` simply add the argument to the `stoq` command::

    $ stoq scan [...] --request-source my_mail
    {
        "results": {
            {
                [...]
                "payload_id": "27774a9a-5a03-4d59-b51b-37583683b666",
                [...]
            }
        }
        "request_meta": {
            "archive_payloads": true,
            "source": "my_mail",
            "extra_data": {}
        },
        "errors": {},
        "time": "...",
        "decorators": {},
        "scan_id": "e107f362-0b40-455e-bfef-da7c606637ca"
    }

Additionally, extra data may be added to RequestMeta by using the ``--request-extra`` command
line argument. This option requires key/value pairs separated by an ``=``::

    $ stoq scan [...] --request-source my_mail --request-extra server=mail-server-01 postfix=true
    {
        "results": {
            {
                [...]
                "payload_id": "27774a9a-5a03-4d59-b51b-37583683b666",
                [...]
            }
        }
        "request_meta": {
            "archive_payloads": true,
            "source": "my_mail",
            "extra_data": {
                "server": "mail-server-01",
                "postfix": true
            }
        },
        "errors": {},
        "time": "...",
        "decorators": {},
        "scan_id": "e107f362-0b40-455e-bfef-da7c606637ca"
    }

Additionally, RequestMeta may be defined when scanning a payload using a ``Stoq`` object::

    >>> import asyncio
    >>> from stoq import Stoq, RequestMeta
    >>> s = Stoq()
    >>> loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    >>> request_meta = RequestMeta(source='my_mail', extra_data={'server': 'mail-server-01', 'postfix': True})
    >>> results = loop.run_until_complete(
    ...     s.scan(b'this is a test payload', request_meta=request_meta)
    ... )
