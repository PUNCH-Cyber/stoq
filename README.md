# Overview

stoQ is a automation framework that helps to simplify the more mundane and
repetitive tasks an analyst is required to do. It allows analysts and
DevSecOps teams the ability to quickly transition from different data sources,
databases, decoders/encoders, and numerous other tasks. stoQ was designed to be
enterprise ready and scalable, while also being lean enough for individual security
researchers.
