    Overview
    ========

    Worker plugins are the primary data producers within `stoQ`. These plugins
    allow for tasks such as scanning payloads with yara, hashing payloads, and
    even extracting indicators of compromise (IOC) from documents. Worker plugins
    can be defined in all scanning modes. Additionally worker plugins can be
    dynamically loaded using dispatching plugins. More information on dispatcher
    plugins can be found in the :ref:`dispatcher plugin section <dispatcher>`.

    Worker plugins can be defined multiple ways. In these examples, we will use
    the ``hash`` worker plugin.

    From the command line, worker plugins can be defined two different ways,
    depending on the use.

    If *only* the original payload must be scanned, then ``--start-dispatch``
    or ``-s`` command line argument may be used.::

        $ stoq scan -s hash [...]

    However, if the original payload and all subsequent payloads must be scanned,
    the ``--always-dispatch`` or ``-a`` command line argument may be used::

        $ stoq scan -a hash [...]

    .. note:: The difference between ``--start-dispatch`` and ``--always-dispatch``
              can be somewhat confusing. The primary difference between the two is
              that if a worker plugin extracts any payloads for further scanning,
              any extracted payloads will only be scanned by workers defined by
              ``--always-dispatch``. If ``--start-dispatch`` was used, the plugin
              defined will not be used to scan any extracted payloads.

    Or, when instantiating the ``Stoq()`` class::

        >>> import stoq
        >>> workers= ['yara']
        >>> s = Stoq(always_dispatch=workers, [...])

    Lastly, worker plugins can be defined by dispatcher plugins. As mentioned previously,
    more information on them can be found in the :ref:`dispatcher plugin section <dispatcher>`

    Writing a plugin
    ================

    A `worker` plugin must be a subclass of the ``WorkerPlugin`` class.

    As with any plugin, a :ref:`configuration file <pluginconfig>` must also exist
    and be properly configured.

    Example
    -------

    ::

        from typing import Dict, List, Optional
        from configparser import ConfigParser

        from stoq.data_classes import (
            Payload,
            RequestMeta,
            WorkerResponse,
        )
        from stoq.plugins import WorkerPlugin


        class ExampleWorker(WorkerPlugin):
            def __init__(self, config: ConfigParser, plugin_opts: Optional[Dict]) -> None:
                super().__init__(config, plugin_opts)
                self.useful = config.get('options', 'useful', fallback=False)

            async def scan(
                self, payload: Payload, request_meta: RequestMeta
            ) -> Optional[WorkerResponse]:
                if self.useful:
                    wr = WorkerResponse({'worker_results': 'something useful'})
                else:
                    wr = WorkerResponse({'worker_results': 'something not useful'})
                return wr

    Extracted Payloads
    ------------------

    Worker plugins may also extract payloads, and return them to ``Stoq`` for
    further analysis. Each extracted payload that is returned will be inserted
    into the same workflow as the original payload.

    ::

        from typing import Dict, List, Optional
        from configparser import ConfigParser

        from stoq.data_classes import (
            ExtractedPayload,
            Payload,
            PayloadMeta,
            RequestMeta,
            WorkerResponse,
        )
        from stoq.plugins import WorkerPlugin


        class ExampleWorker(WorkerPlugin):
            def __init__(self, config: ConfigParser, plugin_opts: Optional[Dict]) -> None:
                super().__init__(config, plugin_opts)
                self.useful = config.get('options', 'useful', fallback=False)

            async def scan(
                self, payload: Payload, request_meta: RequestMeta
            ) -> Optional[WorkerResponse]:
                p = ExtractedPayload(b'Lorem ipsum')
                if self.useful:
                    wr = WorkerResponse({'worker_results': 'something useful'}, extracted=[p])
                else:
                    wr = WorkerResponse({'worker_results': 'something not useful'}, extracted=[p])
                return wr


    Dispatch To
    -----------

    In some cases it may be useful for a worker plugin to dicate which plugins an extracted
    payload is scanned with.

    ::

        from typing import Dict, List, Optional
        from configparser import ConfigParser

        from stoq.data_classes import (
            ExtractedPayload,
            Payload,
            PayloadMeta,
            RequestMeta,
            WorkerResponse,
        )
        from stoq.plugins import WorkerPlugin


        class ExampleWorker(WorkerPlugin):
            def __init__(self, config: ConfigParser, plugin_opts: Optional[Dict]) -> None:
                super().__init__(config, plugin_opts)
                self.useful = config.get('options', 'useful', fallback=False)

            async def scan(
                self, payload: Payload, request_meta: RequestMeta
            ) -> Optional[WorkerResponse]:
                dispatch_meta = PayloadMeta(dispatch_to='yara')
                p = ExtractedPayload(b'this is a payload with bad stuff', dispatch_meta)
                if self.useful:
                    wr = WorkerResponse({'worker_results': 'something useful'}, extracted=[p])
                else:
                    wr = WorkerResponse({'worker_results': 'something not useful'}, extracted=[p])
                return wr
